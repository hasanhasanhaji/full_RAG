    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
    Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task, machine learning systems improve their performance over  time as they are exposed to more data.
    Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
    1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled   dataset, where each input is paired with the correct output. 
    The model learns to map inputs to outputs and can make predictions on new, unseen data.
    2. Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given an unlabeled dataset and must find patterns or structures within the data on its own.
    Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
    3. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward.
