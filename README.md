Full_RAG — Complete RAG Tutorial with LangChain, LangGraph & LangSmith

Welcome to Full_RAG, a complete hands-on tutorial and implementation guide for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems — built with the power of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith.
This repository walks you through every step of designing, implementing, testing, and monitoring an end-to-end RAG pipeline — from document ingestion to evaluation and deployment.

🚀 Features

📘 Comprehensive RAG pipeline

Data ingestion, text splitting, and vectorization

Retrieval and context injection

Response generation and evaluation

⚙️ Built with modern AI frameworks

LangChain
: RAG logic and orchestration

LangGraph
: For workflow graph visualization and control

LangSmith
: For tracing, debugging, and evaluation

🧩 Modular and Extendable

Plug-and-play embeddings and retrievers

Supports both local and cloud LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

🧠 Includes Examples & Tutorials

Jupyter notebooks and scripts for each stage of the pipeline

Visual workflow demonstrations using LangGraph



⚡ Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
