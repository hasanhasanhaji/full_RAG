🧠 Full_RAG — Complete RAG Tutorial with LangChain, LangGraph & LangSmith

Welcome to Full_RAG, a complete hands-on tutorial and implementation guide for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems — built with the power of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith.
This repository walks you through every step of designing, implementing, testing, and monitoring an end-to-end RAG pipeline, from document ingestion to evaluation and deployment.

🚀 Features
📘 Comprehensive RAG Pipeline

Data ingestion, text splitting, and vectorization

Retrieval and context injection

Response generation and evaluation

⚙️ Built with Modern AI Frameworks

LangChain — RAG logic and orchestration

LangGraph — Workflow graph visualization and control

LangSmith — Tracing, debugging, and evaluation

🧩 Modular and Extendable

Plug-and-play embeddings and retrievers

Supports both local and cloud LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

🧠 Includes Examples & Tutorials

Jupyter notebooks and scripts for each stage of the pipeline

Visual workflow demonstrations using LangGraph

⚡ Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/hassan-hajimohammadi/full_RAG.git
cd full_RAG

2. Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Tutorial

Explore the Jupyter notebooks step by step:

jupyter notebook notebooks/


Or run the pipeline directly:

python src/rag_pipeline.py
