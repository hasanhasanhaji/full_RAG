    "    Python has a vast standard library and a large ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for various applications such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. \n",
    "    Its ease of use and versatility have made it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n",
    "    key features of Python include:\n",
    "    1. Easy to Learn and Read: Python's syntax is designed to be clear and straightforward, making it accessible for beginners.\n",
    "    2. Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which allows for quick testing and debugging.\n",
    "    3. Dynamically Typed: You don't need to declare variable types explicitly; Python infers them at runtime.\n",
    "    4. Extensive Libraries: Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks for various tasks like web development (Django, Flask), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn), and more.\n",
    "    5. Cross-Platform: Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",

    "    Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task, machine learning systems improve their performance over  time as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "    Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "    1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled   dataset, where each input is paired with the correct output. \n",
    "    The model learns to map inputs to outputs and can make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "    2. Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given an unlabeled dataset and must find patterns or structures within the data on its own.\n",
    "    Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "    3. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward.    \n",
